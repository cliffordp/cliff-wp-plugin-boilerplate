/**
 * All of the code for your admin-facing JavaScript source
 * should reside in the file "development/admin/js/script.js".
 *
 * Note: It has been assumed you will write jQuery code here, so the
 * $ function reference has been prepared (import $ from 'jquery')for usage within the scope
 * of this function.
 *
 * This enables you to define handlers, for when the DOM is ready:
 *
 * $(function() {
 *
 * });
 *
 * When the window is loaded:
 *
 * $( window ).load(function() {
 *
 * });
 *
 * ...and/or other possibilities.
 *
 * Ideally, it is not considered best practise to attach more than a
 * single DOM-ready or window-load handler for a particular page.
 * Although scripts in the WordPress core, Plugins and Themes may be
 * practising this, we should strive to set a better example in our own work.
 *
 * The file is enqueued from src/Admin/class-Assets.php.
